# Mobile Simulation Game

## Project Overview

During my first year at university, I participated in a national coding competition called ["Nuit de l'Info"](https://www.nuitdelinfo.com/) with a team of five other students. The competition's theme that year was to create a website aimed at raising awareness about STDs. Our team decided to gamify the learning experience and developed a game where users receive messages from characters on their phone and interact with them, shaping their own story.

## The Challenge

We didn't manage to make the game fully playable within the competition's time constraints so almost a year later, I decided to revisit the project to see how much my skills had improved. I set out to recreate the game using the same technologies and similar time constraints.
